This is an embedded C project written for the STM32F429ZITx FPGA board. The goal of this project was to practice following SPI protocols through communication with the GYRO peripheral device. 
Additionally, this project was intended to help practice with reading, understanding and using the STM32's Hardware Abstraction Layer.

Integrating code that I did not write was a fun aspect of this project. Specifically integrating the HAL's functions.
